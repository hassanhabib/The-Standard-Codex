# 0 Leadership

## 0.0 Team-First
True leadership always puts the team first before everything. That includes The Leader's own best interests. Leaders must put their people as the highest priority at all times. People over profit, process and other people.

### 0.0.0 People over Profit
Profitable endeavours that doesn't honor the people working towards achieving these very profits are meant to vanish. Any activity that aims to become profitable must factor the people in as the highest priority.

This includes instances where The People's life balance is favored over overworking for long hours to achieve extra digits in profits. People over profit can go into further sacrifices leaders must make for the benefit of their own people such as customers, markets and everything else that is put on the opposite side of people's best interests.

### 0.0.1 People over Process
Processes are there to ensure people's happiness, success and prosperity. If a process violates any of these three rights then the process must be changed in favor of The People. Some processes may be for the benefit of some of The People but not the others, in which case these processes must also be adjusted to serve and benefit everyone as much as possible.

### 0.0.2 People over People
The Leader's leaders are not more important than The People. Every leader should honor his People over all other people.

## 0.1 Titleless Leadership
The Leader should not await a title to be a leader for his People. Leadership shouldn't change based on some name or title. Leaders are leaders irregardless of whom they work with, where they work at or what they work on.

## 0.2 Thankless Job
The Leader should not expect their work for The People to be rewarded or recognized in any way. Leadership is a thankless job. Leaders protect and care for their People whether they are rewarded, recognized or thanked for it or not.

## 0.3 Seeking to Offer Support
The Leader doesn't wait for his People to ask for help. He seeks to help them even if they didn't ask. Not all People will share what ailes them, The Leader should read between the lines, look up ahead for potential issues and always seek advice and guidance as to how to help his People.

## 0.4 Trust-Driven
The Leader should trust his People to represent him or represent each other. Leadership main fuel is trust. Trustful Leaders go along way with their People.

### 0.4.0 Renewable Trust (N Chances)
Leaders should allow those who violated their trust to get another chance or chances. Everyone deserves a second, third and N chance. It is up to The Leader to determine whether his People deserves a third chance, but a second chance is mandatory no matter how large the fault may be.
